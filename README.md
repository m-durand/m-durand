I'm a Data Scientist with 8 years experience. I am currently leading the DS work at a small consulting firm in Mexico.

I did my MSc thesis (magna cum laude) on Reinforcement Learning (repo pinned right below). You can read it in Spanish ([here.](https://github.com/m-durand/MSc_Thesis/blob/master/final_docs/TesisM.pdf)).

You can ðŸ“« me at mfadurand@gmail.com

I love playing chess ([send me a correspondence challenge here!](https://lichess.org/?user=fleoren#friend)), salsa dancing, gardening and learning languages.
